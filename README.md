# 📌 Overview

**Camera Classifier** is a **Python application** that allows users to capture images from a live camera, label them, train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model, and predict classes in real-time.

The project combines **CustomTkinter GUI**, **OpenCV camera handling**, and a **CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras**, providing a full interactive experience for image classification.

Key features:

1. **Custom class setup**: The user chooses the number of classes (2–10) and their names.
2. **Image collection**: Capture images for each class via live camera feed.
3. **CNN training**: Images are preprocessed and augmented; the model trains with early stopping for robust results.
4. **Real-time prediction**: Predicts class of live frames with optional automatic prediction mode.
5. **Reset functionality**: Clears the model and saved images to start fresh.

This tool is ideal for small-scale image classification experiments, live demonstrations, and learning CNN fundamentals.
